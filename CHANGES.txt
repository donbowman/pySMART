[BUG FIXES]
    * Now properly detects whether a SMART self-test was initiated when
      requested on SAS/SCSI devices.
    * Now properly detects when a SMART self-test has completed on
      SAS/SCSI devices.
    * The values of diagnostic attributes 'Load_Cycle_Pct_Left' and
      'Start_Stop_Pct_Left' are now set to '-' if the manufacturer's
      specification is '0' (unlimited - typical of SSDs).
    * Diagnostic attribute 'Load_Cycle_Pct_Left' now obtains the intended
      default value '-' when not supported by a device.
[ENHANCEMENTS]
    * Disambiguation of SAS from SCSI is more robust for older devices which
      do not support the SAS PHY log command.
    * Extraction of power-on time from SAS/SCSI devices is more robust.
    * The calculated values of diagnostic attributes 'Load_Cycle_Pct_Left' and
      'Start_Stop_Pct_Left' now include the '%' sign.
[ADMINISTRATIVE]
    * Corrected the package manifest to include the GPLv2 license file.
